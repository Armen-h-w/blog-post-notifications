## Getting started:

### Enable the Required Extension:

- If the issue persists, you may need to enable the sockets extension in your PHP configuration. You can typically do this by uncommenting the line extension=sockets in your php.ini file and then restarting your web server.

### Installing:

- composer install
- php migration.php


### Running Queue Worker with RabbitMQ

- php notification.php
